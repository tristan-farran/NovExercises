### 001

There were a fair number of specifics I hadn't seen before (stringIO/Timestamp/multi-indexing), it took me a little while but by going through and looking things up I was able to understand what was going on and after making some small modifications (like going to regular DF from MI Series) make progress solving the exercises.

I definitely would not have been able to write all of this from scratch without looking things up or with a very stringent time-constraint, though that is first-pass and I will get more familiar/speed up.

### Qs

- Will I be allowed to use documentation / assistance tools / look things up?
- What timeframe can I expect?

### Current Thoughts

- I definitely need to practice pandas a bunch as and get really comfortable with it as a first order of business, the syntax is somewhat convoluted.
- I think my first impression is that the longer I have to prepare myself and get to know these tools, the better - though I'll make it work either way.
- I am also really quite unwell and feverish now, so hopefully a swift return to health will assist.
