There were a fair number of specifics I hadn't seen before (stringIO/Timestamp/multi-indexing) and it took me a fair while but by going through and looking things up I was able to understand what was going on and after making some small modifications solve the exercises.

There's no chance I would've been able to write all of this from scratch without looking things up though, but with a bit of time and being allowed to use docs / search / copilot I'm confident I could figure it out in a reasonable amount of time.

I definitely need to get more comfortable with excel-style manipulation with pandas though as I was slow to remember how the lookups and whatnot work, with some elbow grease I can get good at it over the Holidays once I stop sneezing.
