There were a fair number of specifics I hadn't seen before (stringIO/Timestamp/multi-indexing) and it took me a fair while but by going through and looking things up I was able to understand what was going on and after making some modifications (like going to regular DF from MI Series) solve the exercises.

There's no chance I would've been able to write all of this from scratch without looking things up though.

With practice / time / being allowed to use docs / search / copilot I'm confident I could figure it out though.

I definitely need to get much more comfortable with with pandas generally though as I found it rather unintuitive.

I just need to practice a bunch. Hopefully I'm fully healthy shortly and can completely zone in on it.
